## Introduction

This repository serves as my way to help me setup and maintain my Mac. It takes the effort out of installing everything manually. Everything needed to install my preferred setup of macOS is detailed in this readme. Feel free to explore, learn and copy parts for your own dotfiles.

## Getting started

> [!IMPORTANT]
> `mackup` instructions in this readme can be skipped for now. Mackup not supported in newer macOS yet!

### Backup your data

If you're migrating from an existing Mac, you should first make sure to backup all of your existing data. Go through the checklist below to make sure you didn't forget anything before you migrate.

- Did you commit and push any changes/branches to your git repositories?
- Did you remember to save all important documents from non-iCloud directories?
- Did you save all of your work from apps which aren't synced through iCloud?
- Did you remember to export important data from your local database?
- Did you update [mackup](https://github.com/lra/mackup) to the latest version and ran `mackup backup`?

### Setting up your Mac

After backing up your old Mac you may now follow these install instructions to setup a new one.

1. Setup an SSH key
```zsh
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Jin-l1/dotfiles/HEAD/.gitssh | sh -s "<your-email-address>"
```

2. Clone this repo to `~/.dotfiles` with:
```zsh
git clone --recursive git@github.com:Jin-l1/dotfiles.git ~/.dotfiles
```

3. Run the installation with:
```zsh
cd ~/.dotfiles
./fresh.sh
```

4. After mackup is synced with your cloud storage, restore preferences by running `mackup restore`
5. Restart your computer to finalize the process

### Cleaning your old Mac (optionally)

After you've set up your new Mac you may want to wipe and clean install your old Mac. Follow [this article](https://support.apple.com/guide/mac-help/erase-and-reinstall-macos-mh27903/mac) to do that. Remember to [backup your data](#backup-your-data) first!

## Your Own Dotfiles

If you want to start with your own dotfiles from this setup, it's pretty easy to do so. First of all you'll need to fork this repo. After that you can tweak it the way you want.

Go through the [`.macos`](./.macos) file and adjust the settings to your liking. You can find much more settings at [the original script by Mathias Bynens](https://github.com/mathiasbynens/dotfiles/blob/master/.macos) and [Kevin Suttle's macOS Defaults project](https://github.com/kevinSuttle/MacOS-Defaults).

Change the `[user]` entries in [`.gitconfig`](.gitconfig) to your own.

Check out the [`Brewfile`](./Brewfile) file and adjust the apps you want to install for your machine. Use [their search page](https://formulae.brew.sh/cask/) to check if the app you want to install is available.

Check out the `.zshrc`, `.zshenv` and `.zprofile` - adjust to your liking. Likewise, `.bashrc` and `.bash_profile`.

When installing these dotfiles for the first time you'll need to backup all of your settings with Mackup. Install Mackup and backup your settings with the commands below. Your settings will be synced to iCloud so you can use them to sync between computers and reinstall them when reinstalling your Mac. If you want to save your settings to a different directory or different storage than iCloud, [checkout the documentation](https://github.com/lra/mackup/blob/master/doc/README.md#storage).

```zsh
brew install mackup
mackup backup
```
